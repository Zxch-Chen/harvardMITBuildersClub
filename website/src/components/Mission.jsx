          Great things happen when brilliant minds come together. Throughout history, 
          tight-knit communities of builders and thinkers have sparked movements that 
          reshape the world. From the early days of Silicon Valley to the collaborative 
          spaces of today, innovation thrives in circles of ambitious creators.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harvard MIT Builders Club is that circle: a community of deep thinkers, 
          ambitious builders, and innovative spirits who refuse to accept the status quo. 
          We are here to spend our time tackling the hardest problems of our generation 
          and building solutions that matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not think of us as a club. Think of us as a community bound by vision, 
          conviction, and the drive to build what others only imagine.
